# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: ")) #typecasting to float because it takes input in string format
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: ")) #typecasting to float because it takes input in string format
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
BMI = weight/(height*height) 
print(BMI)
